# 2Glasses




2Glasses is a Real-time tank shooter game. 

The game challenges the player to face ennemy forces of different difficulties.

Enemy tanks have a limited quantity of ammunition and they need to refill using reload stations.

## METHOD USED IN THIS PROJECT

### RayCast:

* The enemies detect the player position for chasing.

* For smoother travel along in the map and avoiding obstacles.


### SphereCast:

* The enemies detect the player position for shooting.

* You can check other projects, where I used other techniques (machine learning).
